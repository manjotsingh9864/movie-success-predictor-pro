🌟 Project Overview

AI Movie Success Predictor Pro is a highly advanced machine-learning powered analytical tool that predicts whether a movie will be a HIT or a FLOP based on creative, financial, release-strategy, and quality metrics.

The system analyzes:
	•	🎬 Director & cast popularity
	•	🎞️ Genre, language & production scale
	•	💰 Budget, marketing & investment
	•	📅 Release month & seasonal performance
	•	⭐ Critic & audience expectations
	•	🎭 Franchise & sequel impact
	•	🎦 Screen count & distribution strategy

It then predicts Hit/Flop, gives a confidence score, calculates ROI, shows financial projections, and generates AI-powered recommendations for the film’s performance.

🧠 How the Model Works

The ML model is a classification model trained on 1,000+ movie records containing:
	•	Production details
	•	Director & cast popularity
	•	Budgets & marketing spend
	•	Release timing
	•	Critical & audience performance

The model file: movie_hit_flop_model.pkl
Training dataset: movie_data_2.csv
Workflow:
	1.	User enters movie attributes
	2.	Input is converted into numerical feature vector
	3.	Model predicts Hit / Flop
	4.	Probability → converted to confidence %
	5.	ROI & financials → calculated dynamically
	6.	Visual charts → generated using Plotly
